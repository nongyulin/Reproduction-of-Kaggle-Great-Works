    "# The MOOC Wars: Kaggle's Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of us come to Kaggle to learn. Weather it's through competitions, studying other's code, or reading the discussion threads to get inspired - all in a single, community-driven platform. Yet, this is not where our learning journey typically begins. We start in either college/university classes or online courses on data science and machine learning. It will be instructive to look at the latter style of study in the context of data science students and professinoals.\n",

    "<span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">Massive Open Online Courses</span> (MOOC) have taken the world of learning by storm earlier this decade. No more does one have to be physically present at a brick and mortar institution to learn the subjects of statistics, computer science, and business. World class educators and leading researches are now delivered to your home through the magic of Internet. For free, a small fee, and sometimes heafty sums of $, some platforms even gave you a promise of gainful employment at the end of their certification program [1]. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first MOOC that went \"viral\", so to speak, was actually one on artificial intelligence [2]. Data Sciene/ML along with programming remain some of the most popular courses on these platforms. So, it should come as no surprise that on average <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">Kagglers spend   25% of their learning time engaged with sites like</span> [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com), [edX](https://www.edx.org/), and even Kaggle's very own [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview). \n",
    "\n",
    "Averages, as we know, do not tell a rich story. What does the Kaggle community think about MOOC education? Which learning platforms excel at attracting and keeping DS/ML students? How do the platforms stack up against each other? To answer these question, this notebook will explore a subset of 2018 Kaggle Survey Respondents who participate in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC)."

This makes sense if we consider the advanced classes and rigorous research supervision that is seldom, if ever, found in online learning platforms. MOOC has other shortcommings as well, such as lack of student engagement in class discussion, low completion rates, and lack of feedback [3]. <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">As it stands, online learning can be seen as augmenting education, not replacing it</span>.

    "Among respondents who use multiple MOOC platforms, Coursera holds the highest mindshare. <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">Coursera is where 3,748 Kagglers spend most of their online learning time</span>. DataCamp and Udemy share second place, with roughly equal number of respondents choosing them. Udacity in fourth place, edX in fifth, while Kaggle Learn dropped all the way to #6 spot. To me this suggests that once a learner discovers other MOOC platforms, Kaggle Learn can rarely compete. Still, an impressive performace for a completely free resource. "

    "Does this mean Coursera is three times better than its closest rivals? Not exactly, but we can quantify the comparison better by pitting the MOOCs against one another, one pair at a time. Looking at respondents who use Coursera along with another platform (e.g. DataCamp) and using question 37 (which platform do you use the most?) as a proxy for users preference among platforms, I can see what percentage of people chose Coursera over each of the other platforms in top 5. For example, <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">72% of respondents who have used both Coursera and Udacity (and other platforms potentially), spent more time engaging with the former</span>.

    "## What's next for MOOCs?\n",
    "MOOCs have been around long enough to become established enterprises. In 2018, Forbes estimates that Coursera's revenue alone is close to $140 millionn USD[5]. With the company rumoured to go public, <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">we will see an increased drive for growth from Coursera and its competitors</span> [6]. This growth will be <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">fueled by evergrowing demand in the emerging markets</span> such as India and China, where access to higher education is more limited, as the demand for data science professionals steadily grows. While MOOCs are fighting for Kaggler's mindshare, we should ponder why we do online learning: is it to get an extra notch on our professional belt or is it for the sake of self-development? Answer to that question will help you decide if engaging with any of these learning platforms makes sense for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "For myself, I go to MOOCs for one of two reasons: either out of interest in the subject area or to do a crash course in a technology for the purpose of passing a standardized certification exam. While I'm learning the subject I don't care so much about measurable outcome and while studying for a certification exam, I know the certificate (external to MOOC) is backed by a recognized institution. Online learning works for me in these scenarios, but I'm sure you can find many more uses for it."

    "Aside from the learning platforms that were offered as multiple choice question in the survey, the respondents had an option to select \"Other\" and provide their own answer. Looking at these, I realize that I haven't heard about most of them. Of course, the brand names of Linkedin, YouTube, and Codecademy I'm familiar with, but <span style=\"background-color: #EFFBEF; height: 50%;\">stepik, pluralsight, nptel - this is the first I've heard of these</span>. Even as I tried to Google the resources there were some curious results. For exapmle, with [edureka](www.edureka.co) the second search result on Google was \"Do you mean Udemy?\". It was a clever ad by the more famous MOOC platform. When I went to see what [cognitive class ai](cognitiveclass.ai) is all about, there is an obvious banner ad at the top of the landing page directing me to take a Coursera IBM certification. Finally, [mlcourse.ai](mlcourse.ai) is just an offshoot of [ods.ai](ods.ai), a Russia-based Data Science community.  What's clear is the \"Other\" MOOC platforms are mostly smaller, nieche players that attract only a small fraction of Kagglers to their sites. In the next year's survey I would like Kaggle to include some of the heavyweights in the multiple choice, namely Linkedin and Codecademy, while TheSchool.AI and DataQuest can be left for \"Other\" category to be filled out by those who use them.\n",
