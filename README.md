Reproduction of Kaggle Great Works

These works are really good examples for people to learn how to get useful information from raw data, especially for those who want to be a good Data Scientist.
The reports are also very good templets for us to learn how to write a good report, how to atract readers' attention, how to explain an idea, how to draw conclusion and how to call for actions.

Works:

## 1 Essential Data Skills - Supply and Demand
* Dataset: 
	1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey
* Done By: V Muller
* Language: Python

> Surprised by the figures and pictures created by the author. The author used HTML script to generate beautiful pictures.
	
## 2 Where do People learn ML / DS?
* Dataset: 
	1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey;
	2 100K Coursera's Course Reviews Dataset
* Done By: Martin Barron
* Language: Python

> - Try to use as many datasets as we can could greatly help us to find the real world.
> - A very good example to learn **plotly**

## 3 What Makes a Kaggler Valuable
* Dataset: 
	1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey;
	2 Cost of Living per Country
* Done By: Andre Sionek
* Language: Python

> - Good example to learn **imblearn** to deal with imbalanced data.
> - Good to carefully read and reproduce the code and comments, which not only teach us how to do a good EDA work, and also show us how to be a good Dara Scientist.

## 4 A Tale of 4 Kaggler Types by IDE use 2018 Survey
* Dataset: 
	1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey
* Done By: Rob Muller
* Language: Python

> - Good to know what IDE to learn if you want to be a Data Scientist.
> - Good example for ML


## 5 Russia, USA, India and other countries
* Dataset: 
	1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey;
	2 Cost of Living per Country
* Done By: Andrew Lukyanenko
* Language: Python

 > From the very beginning of this  report, the author already disclosed that "As expected most of the responders are from USA, India and China"
 > However, the author put all the countries into four groups: US, India, Russia, and other countries.
 > Personally speaking, I think it could be better that if the countries were divided into five groups: US, India, China, Russia, and other countries. 
 
 ## 6 The MOOC Wars: Kaggle's Perspective
 * Dataset: 
	1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey
* Done By: Oleksandr(Alex) Akulov
* Language: Python

 > By looking at the platforms mentioned by the survey respnodents, we are able to find out different learning MOOCs, and could try to find some we are interested in.
