Reproduction of Kaggle Great Works

These works are really good examples for people to learn how to get useful information from raw data, especially for those who want to be a good Data Scientist.
The reports are also very good templets for us to learn how to write a good report, how to atract readers' attention, how to explain an idea, how to draw conclusion and how to call for actions.

Works:

** No.1 to No.7 share a common dataset "2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey" 
## 1 Essential Data Skills - Supply and Demand
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey
* Done By: V Muller
* Language: Python

> Surprised by the figures and pictures created by the author. The author used HTML script to generate beautiful pictures.
	
## 2 Where do People learn ML / DS?
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey;
	+ 2 100K Coursera's Course Reviews Dataset
* Done By: Martin Barron
* Language: Python

> - Try to use as many datasets as we can could greatly help us to find the real world.
> - A very good example to learn **plotly**

## 3 What Makes a Kaggler Valuable
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey;
	+ 2 Cost of Living per Country
* Done By: Andre Sionek
* Language: Python

> - Good example to learn **imblearn** to deal with imbalanced data.
> - Good to carefully read and reproduce the code and comments, which not only teach us how to do a good EDA work, and also show us how to be a good Dara Scientist.

## 4 A Tale of 4 Kaggler Types by IDE use 2018 Survey
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey
* Done By: Rob Muller
* Language: Python

> - Good to know what IDE to learn if you want to be a Data Scientist.
> - Good example for ML


## 5 Russia, USA, India and other countries
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey;
	+ 2 Cost of Living per Country
* Done By: Andrew Lukyanenko
* Language: Python

 > From the very beginning of this  report, the author already disclosed that "As expected most of the responders are from USA, India and China"
 > However, the author put all the countries into four groups: US, India, Russia, and other countries.
 > Personally speaking, I think it could be better that if the countries were divided into five groups: US, India, China, Russia, and other countries. 
 
 ## 6 The MOOC Wars: Kaggle's Perspective
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey
* Done By: Oleksandr(Alex) Akulov
* Language: Python

 > By looking at the platforms mentioned by the survey respnodents, we are able to find out different learning MOOCs, and could try to find some we are interested in.


## 7 The MOOC Wars: Kaggle's Perspective
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey
	+ 2 Meta Kaggle
* Done By: beluga
* Language: Python

> Good example to learn LogisticRegression, LinearRegression, RandomForestClassifier, xgboost and etc.

## 8 Cross Validation
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 Melbourne Housing Snapshot ( <em> This is a dataset created by DanB himself. The author provided several good examples to explore the dataset. Good to learn! </em>)
* Done By: DanB
* Language: Python

> Short and brief discription of cross validation. Remember to do cross validation when dataset is small.

## 9 Step by Step Diabetes Classification-KNN-detailed
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 Pima Indians Diabetes Database
* Done By: Shruti_Iyyer
* Language: Python

## 10 Introduction to Decision Trees (Titanic dataset)
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
* Done By: Diego Milla
* Language: Python

> Good to read the notes at the beginning of the script. The reason why to learn Desicion Tree and when to apply Desicion Tree was well explained by the author.

## 11 Naive Bayesian Network with 7 features
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 Porto Seguroâ€™s Safe Driver Prediction
* Done By: J.Jones
* Language: Python

## 12 Logistic Regression Implementation
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set
* Done By: DATAI
* Language: Python

> - Good to learn LR from this script, and also the way that using functions to make the script neat and clean.

## 13 Price analysis and Linear Regression
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 Melbourne Housing Market
* Done By: Tony Pino
* Language: Python

> No comments from the author. Need patient to read the code.

## 14 Predictions with XGboost and Linear Regression
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 House Sales in King County, USA 
* Done By: MuhammetBurakErgenc
* Language: Python


## 15 Visualizing KNN, SVM, and XGBoost on Iris Dataset
* Dataset: 
	+ 1 Iris Species
* Done By: Gabriel Kerr
* Language: Python

> - In this example, the KNN is the simplest model. However, the KNN works much better than SVM and XGBoost for this dataset.
> - Normally, it is better to use feature normalization before model training coud improve the results for this dataset.
